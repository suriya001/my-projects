People may not be able to contact their family, friends and surrounding during emergencies and alert them about their present situation along with their current location. This can be avoided by using digiSOS and activating SOS, which alerts the emergency contacts predefined by the user, through message, and mail along with the user’s current location coordinates.
To grab the attention of the immediate surroundings, loud alert can be used to activate the SOS with high alarming siren. User may also feel to alert the emergency contacts without creating panic of the surrounding, this can be achieved by using the silent SOS option.
There may occur some emergencies to the user to contact ambulance, police and fire station. digiSOS can be used to contact the above mentioned emergency services by a single click. To test whether all the features work efficiently, SOS can be tested by using Test SOS option within the app. Overall, digiSOS can be used during all emergency situations to help the user and to alert their emergency contacts. By default the SOS and call are connected in 10 seconds which can be changed according to user’s personal preference in the settings. Even the emergency contacts and their details can be changed when necessary in the settings provided the emergency contacts will be alerted with this information.
